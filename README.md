# spotify-slsk

## Overview

**spotify-slsk** is a Python-based automation tool that monitors Spotify playlists, searches for matching tracks on Soulseek using the `slskd` API, downloads them based on audio format preferences, and tags them with accurate metadata. It is designed for 24/7 unattended operation and supports error handling, retry logic, and detailed notifications via [ntfy.sh](https://ntfy.sh).

---

## Features

- **üéµ Spotify Integration**: Automatically syncs with public Spotify playlists to track new songs.
- **üîé Smart Searching**: Uses the `slskd` API to find matching tracks on Soulseek, with fuzzy matching for best-fit candidates.
- **‚¨áÔ∏è Controlled Downloads**: Only downloads one file per track at a time; retries once on failure with the next best match.
- **üéØ Format Prioritisation**: Filters search results to prefer specific audio formats (e.g., `.flac`, `.mp3`, `.aiff`) via environment variable.
- **üß† Metadata Tagging**: Automatically tags downloaded files with title, artist, and album metadata using `mutagen`.
- **üßπ Startup Cleanup**: On startup, it verifies existing files, cleans invalid ones, and updates download status.
- **üìÇ Organised Storage**: Moves successfully downloaded and tagged files into dedicated per-playlist folders.
- **üìä SQLite Persistence**: Keeps track of track status, download attempts, and previously tried files to avoid duplication.
- **üîÅ Retry & Suspension Logic**: Skips tracks that failed too many times and retries them after a cooling-off period.
- **üì≤ ntfy.sh Integration**: Sends rich notifications on start, playlist updates, and download completions.
